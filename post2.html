<p>When you start a small business or launch a startup, the one thing you can count on is the unexpected. No matter how thoroughly you plan,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.liveplan.com/blog/the-best-way-to-forecast-sales-and-revenue/">forecast</a>, and test, problems are bound to arise. This is why as an entrepreneur, you need to know how to solve business problems effectively.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>What is problem solving in business?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Problem solving in business relates to establishing processes that mitigate or remove obstacles currently preventing you from reaching&nbsp;<a href="https://www.liveplan.com/blog/vision-setting-achieve-goals/">strategic goals</a>. These are typically complex issues that create a gap between actual results and your desired outcome. They may be present in a single team, operational process, or throughout your entire organization, typically without an immediate or obvious solution.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To approach problem solving successfully, you need to establish consistent processes that help you evaluate, explore solutions, prioritize execution, and measure success. In many ways, it should be similar to how you review business performance through a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.liveplan.com/blog/how-to-run-a-monthly-plan-review-meeting/">monthly plan review</a>. You work through the same documentation, look for gaps, dig deeper to identify the root cause, and hash out options. Without this process, you simply cannot expect to solve problems efficiently or effectively.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Why problem solving is important for your business</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While some would say problem-solving comes naturally, it’s actually a skill you can grow and refine over time. Problem solving skills will help you and your team tackle critical issues and conflicts as they arise. It starts from the top. You as the business owner or CEO needing to display the type of level-headed problem solving that you expect to see from your employees.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Doing so will help you and your staff quickly deal with issues, establish and refine a problem solving process, turn challenges into opportunities, and generally keep a level head. Now, the best business leaders didn’t just find a magic solution to solve their problems, they built processes and leveraged tools to find success. And you can do the same.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By following this 10-step process, you can develop your problem-solving skills and approach any issue that arises with confidence.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>1. Define the problem</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When a problem arises, it can be very easy to jump right into creating a solution. However, if you don’t thoroughly examine what led to the problem in the first place, you may create a strategy that doesn’t actually solve it. You may just be treating the symptoms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For instance, if you realize that your sales from new customers are dropping, your first inclination might be to rush into putting together a marketing plan to increase exposure. But what if decreasing sales are just a symptom of the real problem?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you define the problem, you want to be sure you’re not missing the forest for the trees. If you have a large issue on your hands, you’ll want to look at it from several different angles:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Competition&nbsp;</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Is a competitor’s promotion or pricing affecting your sales? Are there new entrants in your market? How are they marketing their product or business?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Business model&nbsp;</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Is your&nbsp;<a href="https://articles.bplans.com/what-is-a-business-model-business-models-explained/?__hstc=222979076.dd7e634c7dadc99837d600e31c6cf909.1663948829363.1663948829363.1663948829363.1&amp;__hssc=222979076.1.1663948829363&amp;__hsfp=2229535727" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">business model</a>&nbsp;sustainable? Is it realistic for how fast you want to grow? Should you explore different pricing or cost strategies?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Market factors</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How are world events and the nation’s economy affecting your customers and your sales?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Team&nbsp;</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Are there any issues affecting your team? Do they have the tools and resources they need to succeed?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Goal alignment&nbsp;</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Is everyone on your team&nbsp;<a href="https://www.liveplan.com/blog/which-are-better-individual-or-team-goals/">working toward the same goal</a>? Have you communicated&nbsp;<a href="https://articles.bplans.com/how-to-set-smart-business-goals-for-2018/?__hstc=222979076.dd7e634c7dadc99837d600e31c6cf909.1663948829363.1663948829363.1663948829363.1&amp;__hssc=222979076.1.1663948829363&amp;__hsfp=2229535727" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">your short-term and long-term business goals clearly</a>&nbsp;and often?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are a lot of ways to approach the issue when you’re facing a serious business problem. The key is to make sure you’re getting a full snapshot of what’s going on so you don’t waste money and resources on band-aid solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Going back to our example, by looking at every facet of your business, you may discover that you’re spending more on advertising than your competitors already. And instead, there’s a communication gap within your team that’s leading to the mishandling of new customers and therefore lost sales.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you jumped into fixing the exposure of your brand, you would have been dumping more money into an area you’re already winning. Potentially leading to greater losses as more and more new customers are dropped due to poor internal communication.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is why it’s so vital that you explore your blind spots and track the problem to its source.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>2. Conduct a SWOT analysis</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All good businesses solve some sort of problem for customers. What if your particular business problem is actually an opportunity, or even a strength if considered from a different angle? This is when you’d want to conduct a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.liveplan.com/blog/what-is-a-swot-analysis-and-how-to-do-it-right-with-examples/">SWOT analysis</a>&nbsp;to determine if that is in fact the case.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>SWOT is a great tool for&nbsp;<a href="https://articles.bplans.com/why-swot-analysis-belongs-in-your-business-plan/?__hstc=222979076.dd7e634c7dadc99837d600e31c6cf909.1663948829363.1663948829363.1663948829363.1&amp;__hssc=222979076.1.1663948829363&amp;__hsfp=2229535727" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strategic planning</a>&nbsp;and bringing multiple viewpoints to the table when you’re looking at investing resources to solve a problem. This may even be incorporated in your attempts to identify the source of your problem, as it can quickly outline specific strengths and weaknesses of your business. And then by identifying any potential opportunities or threats, you can utilize your findings to kickstart a solution.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>3. Identify multiple solutions with design thinking</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you approach solving your problem, you may want to consider using the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ideou.com/pages/design-thinking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">design thinking approach</a>. It’s often used by organizations looking to solve big, community-based problems. One of its strengths is that it requires involving a wide range of people in the problem-solving process. Which leads to multiple perspectives and solutions arising.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This approach—applying your company’s skills and expertise to a problem in the market—is the basis for design thinking.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s not about finding the most complex problems to solve, but about finding common needs within the organization and in the real world and coming up with solutions that fit those needs. When you’re solving business problems, this applies in the sense that you’re looking for solutions that address underlying issues—you’re looking at the big picture.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>4. Conduct market research and customer outreach</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://articles.bplans.com/how-to-do-market-research/?__hstc=222979076.dd7e634c7dadc99837d600e31c6cf909.1663948829363.1663948829363.1663948829363.1&amp;__hssc=222979076.1.1663948829363&amp;__hsfp=2229535727" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Market research</a>&nbsp;and customer outreach aren’t the sorts of things small business owners and startups can do once and then cross off the list. When you’re facing a roadblock, think back to the last time you did some solid market research or took a deep dive into&nbsp;<a href="https://articles.bplans.com/no-competition-not-possible/?__hstc=222979076.dd7e634c7dadc99837d600e31c6cf909.1663948829363.1663948829363.1663948829363.1&amp;__hssc=222979076.1.1663948829363&amp;__hsfp=2229535727" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">understanding the competitive landscape</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Market research and the insights you get from customer outreach aren’t a silver bullet. Many companies struggle with what they should do with conflicting data points. But it’s worth struggling through and gathering information that can help you better understand&nbsp;<a href="https://articles.bplans.com/how-to-define-your-target-market/?__hstc=222979076.dd7e634c7dadc99837d600e31c6cf909.1663948829363.1663948829363.1663948829363.1&amp;__hssc=222979076.1.1663948829363&amp;__hsfp=2229535727" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">your target market</a>. Plus, your customers can be one of the best sources of criticism. It’s actually a gift if you can&nbsp;<a href="https://articles.bplans.com/how-to-embrace-online-review-sites/?__hstc=222979076.dd7e634c7dadc99837d600e31c6cf909.1663948829363.1663948829363.1663948829363.1&amp;__hssc=222979076.1.1663948829363&amp;__hsfp=2229535727" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">avoid taking the negatives personally</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The worst thing you can do when you’re facing challenges is isolating yourself from your customers and ignore your competition. So survey your customers. Put together a&nbsp;<a href="https://articles.bplans.com/develop-competitive-matrix-plan-pitch/?__hstc=222979076.dd7e634c7dadc99837d600e31c6cf909.1663948829363.1663948829363.1663948829363.1&amp;__hssc=222979076.1.1663948829363&amp;__hsfp=2229535727" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">competitive matrix</a>.&nbsp;<a href="https://cta-service-cms2.hubspot.com/ctas/v2/public/cs/c/?cta_guid=c6c29dca-1671-4224-b317-266db8a9db3d&amp;signature=AAH58kH_dfzjkcC7XjWBCkzgXVfUbsPZBw&amp;placement_guid=8e601c97-b4d8-469b-8129-1196c6a2d626&amp;click=fec23286-f25d-4ab7-8fdc-004e33946510&amp;hsutk=dd7e634c7dadc99837d600e31c6cf909&amp;canon=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.liveplan.com%2Fblog%2Fthe-best-ways-to-approach-problem-solving-in-business%2F&amp;portal_id=467363&amp;redirect_url=APefjpFP_AQUbrs4_kSOotyT9OdTpkuZgVNhC5-iwU_yY1-vB59ZqBXhcE7nzhaxbKuNMyshPY8EhXkWijdl0w70d14566s51mKHv2SXxRL8llkpkeD6nCfOtvOX3QrRxtEJQehc3CuY5WcI8xfJtQoCY2y_YNVICA&amp;__hstc=222979076.dd7e634c7dadc99837d600e31c6cf909.1663948829363.1663948829363.1663948829363.1&amp;__hssc=222979076.1.1663948829363&amp;__hsfp=2229535727"></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>5. Seek input from your team and your mentors</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don’t do your SWOT analysis or design thinking work by yourself. The freedom to express concerns, opinions, and ideas will allow people in an organization to speak up. Their feedback is going to help you move faster and more efficiently. If you have a team in place, bring them into the discussion. You hired them to be experts in their area; use their expertise to navigate and dig deeper into underlying causes of problems and potential solutions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you’re running your business solo, at least bring in a trusted mentor.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.score.org/find-mentor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SCORE offers a free business mentorship program</a>&nbsp;if you don’t already have one. It can also be helpful to connect with a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.liveplan.com/advisors">strategic business advisor</a>, especially if business financials aren’t your strongest suit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Quoting Stephen Covey, who said that “strength lies in differences, not in similarities,” speaking to the importance of diversity when it comes to problem-solving in business.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.liveplan.com/blog/4-ways-to-cultivate-workplace-creativity-a-liveplan-guide/">The more diverse a team is</a>, the more often innovative solutions to the problems faced by the organization appear.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, it has been found that groups that show greater diversity were better at solving problems than groups made up specifically of highly skilled problem solvers. So whoever you bring in to help you problem-solve, resist the urge to surround yourself with people who already agree with you about everything.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>6. Apply lean planning for nimble execution</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So you do your SWOT analysis and your design thinking exercise. You come up with a set of strong, data-driven ideas. But implementing them requires you to adjust your budget, or your strategic plan, or even your understanding of your target market.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Are you willing to change course? Can you quickly make adjustments? Well in order to grow,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.liveplan.com/blog/business-planning-and-innovation-from-annual-to-agile/">you can’t be afraid to be nimble</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By adopting the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.liveplan.com/blog/an-introduction-to-lean-planning/">lean business planning method</a>—the process of revising your business strategy regularly—you’ll be able to shift your strategies more fluidly. You don’t want to change course every week, and you don’t want to fall victim to shiny object thinking. But you can strike a balance that allows you to&nbsp;<a href="https://liveplan.com/blog/why-risk-takers-are-winners-and-why-all-entrepreneurs-should-take-risks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reduce your business’s risk</a>&nbsp;while keeping your team heading in the right direction.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Along the way, you’ll make strategic decisions that don’t pan out the way you hoped. The best thing you can do is test your ideas and iterate often so you’re not wasting money and resources on things that don’t work. That’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.liveplan.com/blog/building-business-strategy/">Lean Planning</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>7. Model different financial scenarios</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you’re trying to solve a serious business problem, one of the best things you can do is build a few different&nbsp;<a href="https://www.liveplan.com/blog/the-best-way-to-forecast-sales-and-revenue/">financial forecasts</a>&nbsp;so you can model different scenarios. You might find that the idea that seemed the strongest will take longer than you thought to reverse a negative financial trend. At the very least you’ll have better insight into the financial impact of moving in a different direction.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The real benefit here is looking at different tactical approaches to the same problem. Maybe instead of increasing sales right now, you’re better off in the long run if you adopt a strategy to reduce churn and retain your best customers. You won’t know unless you model a few different scenarios. You can do this by using spreadsheets, and a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.liveplan.com/features/business-dashboard">tool like LivePlan</a>&nbsp;can make it easier and quicker.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>8. Watch your cash flow</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While you’re working to solve a challenging business problem, pay particular attention to your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.liveplan.com/blog/cash-flow-metrics-minute/">cash flow</a>&nbsp;and your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.liveplan.com/blog/3-key-things-watch-youre-forecasting-cash-flow/">cash flow forecast</a>. Understanding when your company is at risk of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.liveplan.com/blog/metrics-in-a-minute-cash-burn-rate/">running out of cash</a>&nbsp;in the bank can help you be proactive. It’s a lot easier to get a line of credit while your financials still look good and healthy, than when you’re one pay period away from ruin.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you’re dealing with a serious issue, it’s easy to start to get tunnel vision. You’ll benefit from maintaining a little breathing room for your business as you figure out what to do next.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>9. Use a decision-making framework</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once you’ve gathered all the information you need, generated a number of ideas, and done some financial modeling, you might still feel uncertain. It’s natural—you’re not a fortune-teller. You’re trying to make the best decision you can with the information you have.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://firstround.com/review/this-matrix-helps-growing-teams-make-great-decisions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This article offers a really useful approach</a>&nbsp;to making decisions. It starts with putting your options into a matrix like this one:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":11661,"linkDestination":"custom"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.liveplan.com/content/uploads/2021/08/LivePlan-Blog-Images.jpg"><img src="https://www.liveplan.com/content/uploads/2021/08/LivePlan-Blog-Images.jpg" alt="LivePlan Blog Images" class="wp-image-11661" title="10 Step Process for Effective Business Problem Solving 3"/></a></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Use this sort of framework to put everything you’ve learned out on the table. If you’re working with a bigger team, this sort of exercise can also bring the rest of your team to the table so they feel some ownership over the outcome.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>10. Identify key metrics to track</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How will you know your problem is solved? And not just the symptom—how will you know when you’ve addressed the underlying issues? Before you dive into enacting the solution, make sure you know what success looks like.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Decide on a few&nbsp;<a href="https://www.liveplan.com/blog/what-startup-metrics-should-i-track/">key performance indicators</a>. Take a baseline measurement, and set a goal and a timeframe. You’re essentially translating your solution into a plan, complete with milestones and goals. Without these, you’ve simply made a blind decision with no way to track success. You need those&nbsp;<a href="https://www.liveplan.com/blog/milestones-as-business-roadmap/">goals and milestones to make your plan real</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Problem solving skills to improve</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you and your team work through this process, it’s worth keeping in mind specific problem solving skills you should continue to develop. Bolstering your ability, as well as your team, to solve problems effectively will only make this process more useful and efficient. Here are a few key skills to work on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Emotional intelligence</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It can be very easy to make quick, emotional responses in a time of crisis or when discussing something you’re passionate about. To avoid making assumptions and letting your emotions get the best of you, you need to focus on empathizing with others. This involves understanding your own emotional state, reactions and listening carefully to the responses of your team. The more you’re able to listen carefully, the better you’ll be at asking for and taking advice that actually leads to effective problem solving.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Research</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jumping right into a solution can immediately kill the possibility of solving your problem. Just like when&nbsp;<a href="https://articles.bplans.com/business-ideas/7-steps-to-starting-your-own-business/?__hstc=222979076.dd7e634c7dadc99837d600e31c6cf909.1663948829363.1663948829363.1663948829363.1&amp;__hssc=222979076.1.1663948829363&amp;__hsfp=2229535727" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you start a business</a>, you need to do the research into what the problem you’re solving actually is. Luckily, you can embed research into your problem solving by holding active reviews of financial performance and team processes. Simply asking “What? Where? When? How?” can lead to more in-depth explorations of potential issues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The best thing you can do to grow your research abilities is to encourage and practice curiosity. Look at every problem as an opportunity. Something that may be trouble now, but is worth exploring and finding the right solution. You’ll pick up best practices, useful tools and fine-tune your own research process the more you’re willing to explore.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Brainstorming</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Creatively brainstorming with your team is somewhat of an art form. There needs to be a willingness to throw everything at the wall and act as if nothing is a bad idea at the start. This style of collaboration encourages participation without fear of rejection. It also helps outline potential solutions outside of your current scope, that you can refine and turn into realistic action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Work on breaking down problems and try to give everyone in the room a voice. The more input you allow, the greater potential you have for finding the best solution.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Decisiveness</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One thing that can drag out acting upon a potential solution, is being indecisive. If you aren’t willing to state when the final cutoff for deliberation is, you simply won’t take steps quickly enough. This is when having a process for problem solving comes in handy, as it purposefully outlines when you should start taking action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Work on choosing decision-makers, identify necessary results and be prepared to analyze and adjust if necessary. You don’t have to get it right every time, but taking action at the right time, even if it fails, is almost more vital than never taking a step.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Resilience</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stemming off failure, you need to learn to be resilient. Again, no one gets it perfect every single time. There are so many factors in play to consider and sometimes even the most well-thought-out solution doesn’t stick. Instead of being down on yourself or your team, look to separate yourself from the problem and continue to think of it as a puzzle worth solving. Every failure is a learning opportunity and it only helps you further refine and eliminate issues in your strategy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
